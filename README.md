# Next Generation Decision Making - Pragmatic Artificial Intelligence

**I have just starting building this repository for my March 20/21 2019 course on O'Reilly Safari.
Many thanks to Packt for this opportunity to share my views on AI**

**This course gets you going deep into AI in less than a minute!**

The Edge Detection example, https://github.com/Denis2054/NEXTGENAI/blob/master/Edge_detection_V3.ipynb, is just to show that you won't need to install, download or configure anything during the course:<br>
a) you can read the Juypter Notebook and see the results of the programs by just opening it <br>
b) you can run it in Google Colaboratory for free, online, by just clicking on the Colab button<br>
c) if you wish and only so,  you can download the notebook which contains the program you can run on your machine<br>

All of rest the material will be uploaded and available 48h before the beginning of the course.<br>
