## Outline

Outline of the course
This course provides a comprehensive view of how artificial intelligence can provide decision-making tools for a wide range of problems to solve. The course shows how AI can analyze, predict and anticipate problems providing preventive decision making in real-time.<br><br>
You will explore how to apply artificial intelligence to specific profit-generating areas in your company and use cutting-edge machine learning performance measurements to make real-time decisions. <br><br>

This course covers the key aspects of artificial intelligence from the tools to their implementation on local servers or cloud platforms. We will take a project-based approach to understand how future AI solutions are built and the best use cases for deploying them. Once implemented, we will discover how to use these AI tools for predictive and preventive decision-making.<br><br>

We will start by exploring the building blocks of artificial intelligence through programs and videos that will be run live. At that point, you will have fully understood the tools involved and will see how to maximize your company or personal projects. <br><br>

One of the leitmotivs of the course will be to introduce you to chaos engineering techniques first introduced by Netflix and recommended for all businesses. We will use proven AI Automated Planning Management algorithms to apply chaos engineering to predict unforeseen events classical techniques cannot detect.<br><br>

We will see how artificial intelligence enhances optimizing profit by interacting with big data, AI automated planning and AI supply chain management tools(SCM). At each step, you will discover how to implement a solution now in a very pragmatic way based on real-life case studies.<br><br>

Finally, we move to manage a project involving standard software (CRM, ERP, SCM) and the full range of artificial intelligence tools and extensions. We will optimize an entire supply chain from e-commerce to delivery exploring service production, product production, storage, and delivery constraints. We will see how to motivate your workforce and automatically detect slight perturbations in your strategic plans to avoid major problems.<br><br>

By the end of this course, you will be confident enough to manage an artificial intelligence project from scratch to successful implementation for your users using local servers, cloud platforms such as Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud, Microsoft Azure, and IBM Cloud.  You will master the power of chaos management machine learning algorithms that will provide predictions and automated problem-solving solutions.<br><br>

## What is this training about, and why is it important?<br><br>

Modern day management requires to have a strategic vision. That vision is challenged on a daily basis of unforeseen problems that require unplanned energy and resources. This course will show how to use the power of pragmatic artificial intelligence KPI (Key Performance Indicators) that contain predictive and preventive decision-making information. You will discover the cutting edge methods of machine learning chaos management.<br><br>

This training is aimed at teaching you how to implement pragmatic quick win profit generating artificial intelligence projects on a local or cloud platform. You will explore the innovating combination of state of art artificial intelligence tools and innovative real-time AI management methods..<br><br>

## This Live Training is for you because…
The course is aimed at managers, consultants, developers/IT Operations who wish to enhance their artificial intelligence management skills and culture.  If you have had a hard time finding how to use artificial intelligence in a pragmatic realistic way, here is your one-stop opportunity!<br><br>
## Prerequisites <br>
Artificial Intelligence by Example <br><br>
It would be a good idea to go through the book before the course. No need to understand the programs but focus on the real-life case studies in the book. They are all based on real-life projects (names and confidential technology changed) that generated profit for major corporations.<br><br>
No developing experience is required.<br><br>
Note: Developers that are present will learn how to manage projects and fully understand the constraints of project management.<br><br>

## Preparation <br><br>
The principal preparation is for you to think of how you would like to use artificial intelligence in your company. What aspect of your company would you like to optimize? Where is the productivity lagging? Which area in your company would predictive and preventive decision making be useful? Which decisions would like to automate and which would you like to make on your own with AI KPIs (Key Performance Indicators)?<br>
Write down a few basic questions and answers you would like to start building your project with. <br>
You will be implementing this during the live training on your website (you can turn it on and off during testing). Then you will be learning how to deploy it on several key platforms. <br>
You will be learning how to implement your project during the live training. You will fully understand how to deploy artificial intelligence in your company using ground-breaking technology.<br>
You will be able to apply what you learned right after the course through a pragmatic step by step method.<br>

How it has become impossible to make accurate decisions with the amount and variety of data that is now available. The information input changes so quickly it has become a challenge to adapt and replan a strategy.  Automated Planning and Scheduling using Machine Learning algorithms can parse all the data available, distinguish reliable from unreliable data, key indicators and valuable decision making information. We will explore real-life AI case studies for data centers, services, and manufacturing.
